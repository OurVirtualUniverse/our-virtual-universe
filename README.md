# our-virtual-universe
Initial repository for Our Virtual Universe

## Welcome
Our goal here is to create the GNU/Linux of MMORPGs in hopes that we might attain
a modular, distributed, and integrated universe of interconnected virtual worlds,
each either _naturally_ created (Anyone wanna volunteer for the Nature team?)
or owned/created by an entity (the players themselves).

Please join us in creating what we hope will become the largest and most versatile
MMORPG known for the rest of eternity.
Everyone is welcome to contribute and benefit. :)

## Vision
