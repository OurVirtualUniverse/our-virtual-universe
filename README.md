# our-virtual-universe
Initial repository for Our Virtual Universe

## Welcome
Our goal here is to create the GNU/Linux of MMORPGs in hopes that we might attain
a modular, distributed, and integrated universe of interconnected virtual worlds,
each either _naturally_ created (Anyone wanna volunteer for the Nature team?)
or owned/created by an entity (the players themselves).

Join us in creating the biggest and most versatile MMORPG known to humankind.
Other kinds of beings are also welcome to contribute and benefit. :)
