# our-virtual-universe
Our goal here is to create the GNU/Linux of MMORPGs in hopes that we might attain
a modular, distributed, and integrated universe of interconnected virtual worlds
each either _naturally_ created or owned/created by an entity (the players themselves).

Join us in creating the biggest and most versatile MMORPG known to humankind.
Other kinds of beings are also welcome to contribute and benefit. :)
